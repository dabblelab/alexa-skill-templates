## Overview
This is the first video in a series for new Amazon Alexa developers who are also new to programming with Node.js. In this video, I introduce asynchronous coding in Node.js and outline a simple code pattern for writing asynchronous functions using a callback. This video should be helpful for anyone who is getting started with Node.js but especially if you’re using Node.js for building Alexa Skills.
